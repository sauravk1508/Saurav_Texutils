// Import Export in React
// Importing and exporting in React JS will help us write modular code, i.e., splitting code into multiple files. Importing allows using contents from another file, whereas exporting makes the file contents eligible for importing. The basic idea behind imports and exports is to exchange contents between several JavaScript files.
export default App;
